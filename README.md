###Why I found this interesting
I think this article does a great job of delving into the impacts of AI in the world od development. It focuses on how changes have occurred in the past and aims to make predictions about what the future holds. The writer doesn't try to scare developers but rather talks of the shift and positive, as well as negative, changes that AI will bring

Further, I enjoyed how he talks of the skillset developers need to build to not be replaced by AI, highlighting the importance of the 'human' aspect in development processes
