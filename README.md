### Why I found this interesting
I think this article does a great job of delving into the impacts of AI in the world od development. It focuses on how changes have occurred in the past and aims to make predictions about what the future holds. The writer doesn't try to scare developers but rather talks of the shift and positive, as well as negative, changes that AI will bring

Further, I enjoyed how he talks of the skillset developers need to build to not be replaced by AI, highlighting the importance of the 'human' aspect in development processes

This is a great article on the changing landscape of software engineering. Job security has been a big topic in tech the last few years, and this article does a good job discussing the emerging important skills that will be relecant in the future, such as the ability to outline and break down complex problems, and have a higher level of understanding than an LLM can have. Adapting to focus on big picture problems rather than being good at fixing small things will be crucial for engineers in the future.
